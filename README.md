# Problem Statement:
A grocery store wants to calculate the total cost of items purchased by a customer.
- Calculate the total cost of 3 different items.
- Add a 10% discount if the total exceeds $50.
- Display the final payable amount.


# Approach:
1.We take the prices of three individual items as input from the user.


2.We add these three prices together to get the Initial Total.


3.Apply Discount (Conditional):
   1.We check if the Initial Total is more than $50.


   2.If it is, we calculate a 10% discount and subtract it from the total.
   

   3.If it is $50 or less, no discount is applied.


4.The script displays the final amount the customer needs to pay, formatted as currency.


# Sample Output:


---Billing Details---


Total Cost: $60.00


Discount: $6.00


Final Cost: $54.00
